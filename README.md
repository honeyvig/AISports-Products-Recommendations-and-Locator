# AISports-Products-Recommendations-and-Locator
Designing a mobile application that assists shoppers in identifying and locating products within a sporting goods store requires the integration of several key components. These components include:

    Mobile App Development Framework (such as React Native, Flutter, or native Android/iOS development).
    AI/ML for Product Recommendations and Product Location.
    UI/UX Design for a seamless shopping experience.
    Integration with a Database for storing product data and user preferences.
    Geolocation and Indoor Mapping for locating products within the store.

Below is a high-level design for such an app using Python for backend AI/ML logic, and React Native (or another mobile framework) for the front end. The app could be further extended for Android and iOS deployment.
Step 1: Backend Setup for AI/ML (Product Recommendation & Locator)

We'll use Python for AI/ML logic. The app's backend will be responsible for processing user input and generating product recommendations, as well as identifying the location of products within the store.
Backend Requirements:

    Product Database: A database containing product information, including product IDs, names, categories, descriptions, and locations (aisle number, shelf, etc.).
    Recommendation System: A machine learning model that provides recommendations based on user preferences, past behavior, or search queries.
    Product Location: Mapping of products to specific locations within the store, such as aisles and shelves.

Let's start by creating a simple product recommendation system using Python (with scikit-learn and pandas for ML, and Flask for API).
Backend: Flask App with AI/ML Integration

    Product Recommendation System (based on collaborative filtering or content-based filtering).
    Flask API to serve product recommendations.

Install Dependencies:

pip install flask scikit-learn pandas numpy

Backend Code (Flask):

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
import numpy as np

app = Flask(__name__)

# Example data: Product database with ID, name, and category
products = pd.DataFrame({
    'product_id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'name': ['Football', 'Basketball', 'Baseball Bat', 'Tennis Racket', 'Soccer Ball'],
    'category': ['Football', 'Basketball', 'Baseball', 'Tennis', 'Soccer'],
    'aisle': ['A1', 'A2', 'B1', 'C1', 'D1'],
    'shelf': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
})

# Mock user preference data (for simplicity)
user_data = {
    'user_1': [1, 2, 3],  # User_1 has purchased Football, Basketball, and Baseball Bat
    'user_2': [3, 4, 5],  # User_2 has purchased Baseball Bat, Tennis Racket, and Soccer Ball
}

# Feature extraction (this could be expanded based on real data)
def extract_features():
    feature_matrix = pd.DataFrame({
        'Football': [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        'Basketball': [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
        'Baseball Bat': [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
        'Tennis Racket': [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
        'Soccer Ball': [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
    }).T
    return feature_matrix

# Recommend products based on user's purchase history
def recommend_products(user_id):
    purchased = user_data.get(user_id, [])
    product_features = extract_features()

    # Build a nearest neighbor model (simple recommendation system)
    model = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=2, metric='cosine')
    model.fit(product_features)

    recommendations = []

    for product_id in purchased:
        distances, indices = model.kneighbors([product_features.iloc[product_id - 1].values])
        for idx in indices[0]:
            if idx != product_id - 1:
                recommendations.append(products.iloc[idx]['name'])

    return recommendations

@app.route('/get_recommendations', methods=['GET'])
def get_recommendations():
    user_id = request.args.get('user_id')
    recommendations = recommend_products(user_id)
    return jsonify({'recommendations': recommendations})

@app.route('/get_product_location', methods=['GET'])
def get_product_location():
    product_name = request.args.get('product_name')
    product = products[products['name'].str.lower() == product_name.lower()]
    if not product.empty:
        location = product[['aisle', 'shelf']].iloc[0]
        return jsonify(location.to_dict())
    else:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Product not found'}), 404

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Explanation of Backend Code:

    Product Recommendation:
        The recommend_products() function uses a basic nearest neighbors approach to recommend products based on user purchase history.
        The extract_features() function generates product features. You can modify this function to incorporate more data like user reviews, product attributes, etc.

    Product Location:
        The /get_product_location route accepts a product_name as a query parameter and returns the aisle and shelf of that product.

    Flask API:
        This app serves two endpoints:
            /get_recommendations: Returns product recommendations for a given user.
            /get_product_location: Returns the aisle and shelf location for a specific product.

Step 2: Mobile App Development (React Native Example)

Now, let's create a simple React Native app that communicates with the Flask API to retrieve recommendations and product locations. This app will display the recommended products and show the aisle/shelf location of products in the store.
Install React Native CLI and Dependencies:

npx react-native init SportingGoodsApp
cd SportingGoodsApp
npm install axios react-navigation react-navigation-stack
npx react-native link

Mobile App Code (React Native):

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, FlatList, TextInput } from 'react-native';
import axios from 'axios';

const App = () => {
  const [userId, setUserId] = useState('user_1'); // Default user
  const [recommendations, setRecommendations] = useState([]);
  const [productLocation, setProductLocation] = useState(null);
  const [productName, setProductName] = useState('');

  // Fetch recommendations when the user ID changes
  const fetchRecommendations = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get(`http://localhost:5000/get_recommendations?user_id=${userId}`);
      setRecommendations(response.data.recommendations);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching recommendations:', error);
    }
  };

  // Fetch product location when the product name changes
  const fetchProductLocation = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get(`http://localhost:5000/get_product_location?product_name=${productName}`);
      setProductLocation(response.data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching product location:', error);
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchRecommendations();
  }, [userId]);

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, padding: 20 }}>
      <Text>Welcome to Sporting Goods Store</Text>

      {/* User Input for Product Search */}
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Enter product name"
        value={productName}
        onChangeText={setProductName}
      />
      <Button title="Find Product Location" onPress={fetchProductLocation} />

      {/* Product Location */}
      {productLocation && (
        <View>
          <Text>Aisle: {productLocation.aisle}</Text>
          <Text>Shelf: {productLocation.shelf}</Text>
        </View>
      )}

      {/* Recommended Products List */}
      <FlatList
        data={recommendations}
        keyExtractor={(item, index) => index.toString()}
        renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item}</Text>}
      />

      {/* Change User ID */}
      <Button title="Switch User" onPress={() => setUserId(userId === 'user_1' ? 'user_2' : 'user_1')} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;

Explanation of Mobile App Code:

    State Management: The app uses React Native's useState to manage the userId, recommendations, productLocation, and productName inputs.

    Fetching Data:
        The fetchRecommendations function makes a GET request to the Flask backend to retrieve product recommendations based on the userId.
        The fetchProductLocation function makes a GET request to get the aisle and shelf for a specific product based on the productName.

    Rendering: The app displays:
        Recommended products based on the userâ€™s purchase history.
        Product location (aisle and shelf) when the user searches for a product by name.

Step 3: Running the Application

    Backend:

        Start the Flask backend by running the following command:

    python app.py

Mobile App:

    Run the React Native app on your simulator/emulator or device:

npx react-native run-android

or

        npx react-native run-ios

Conclusion

This setup provides a foundation for a mobile app that assists shoppers in identifying and locating products within a sporting goods store. It combines AI-based product recommendations and real-time product location data using a simple Flask backend and a React Native frontend. The recommendation system can be further enhanced using more advanced AI/ML techniques, and the UI can be expanded for a more polished user experience.
